    <p class="Imperative">I have been thinking that stress levels are high for all of us.</p>
    <p class="Imperative">Ok, breathe... breathe... relax.</p>
    <p class="Imperative">I know that we all have a lot of school work to do right now and it<br>
      feels overwheming.  I want to help you with
    that feeling.</p>
    <p class="Imperative">Remember that for my class every assignment is connected to the<br>
      ones that came before; they should be done in order so that they make<br>
    sense. </p>
    <p class="Imperative">We are all working at diffferent times and at different paces, so<br>
    don't worry too much about deadlines--it's like my class has become<br>
    a personal journey that I'm helping each, individual student with. </p>
    <p class="Imperative">So, if you're really behind, just start sometime: every journey begins<br>
      with a single footstep.
    </p>
    <p class="Imperative">Take a break today. Think about things that are less stressful.</p>
    <p class="Imperative">If computer science is something that is less stressful for you, click<br>
      <a href="https://rmarque.github.io/realagenda.html">here</a> to see what the agenda was really supposed to be, otherwise<br>
      check back tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="Imperative">Be healthy, safe, and sane.</p>
