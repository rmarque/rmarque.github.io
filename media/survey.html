<h3>The Magnet was awarded a grant from Verizon last October
  <br>
  and it requires that we teach certain things to you in the<br>
  9th grade.<br>
  <br>
We will be visited next week to see how we're doing.<br>
<br>
Before the visit, they'd like you to complete s survey.<br>
<br>
One thing to remember: answer honestly and to the best<br>
of your ability--if you're confused about a question, answer<br>
it as best you can.<br>
<br>
Hint: the &quot;Design-Thinking Process&quot; discussed in the survey<br>
is really juse the Engineering-Design Process that Ms. Salamanca<br>
taught you and the Problem Solving Process that Mr. MÃ¡rquez<br>
taught you.</h3>
